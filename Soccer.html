<font size="4">Soccer has helped me meet my closest friends and see new places, when traveling. I wouldn't trade the experiences and knowledge I have gained from this 13 year adventure for anything. I am so thankful my parents had me start playing early on so I could achieve the highest level of expertise possible.</font> </p>
